    <h1>HISTORY OF DIPLOMAT HOTEL</h1>
    <p>Diplomat Hotel, a fascinating old building with an interesting and spooky past. The Diplomat Hotel was first built as a place for people to relax in the early 1900s, served as a rest house and seminary way back 1911, before it was developed into a school and later transformed into a hotel and played witness to significant events during World War II. The Diplomat Hotel combines important history, impressive architecture, and a spooky atmosphere, making it a great place to visit for history lovers and adventure seekers. 
    </p>
    <p>The Diplomat Hotel, first called the Dominican Hill Retreat House, stood on a hill and was called Dominican Hill since then, it was built in 1915 for Dominican friars to use as a vacation spot. Later, it turned into a hotel run by the Dominican Order. During World War II, the Japanese Imperial Army took over the hotel, and it became a refuge for civilians.
    </p>
    <p>Sadly, the hotel became a target of bombings during the war, and many people died there. In 1973, Antonio Agapito “Tony” Agpaoa, the new owner, turned it into The Diplomat Hotel. It became a popular tourist spot for a while, but money problems caused it to close in the 1980s, and the owner, who is a faith healer, and psychic surgeon passed away inside the building. And it is believed that a fire once broke out in the hotel, trapping and killing many guests. There was also a nurse who jumped from the rooftop and died. And the structure was destroyed by the 1990 earthquake.

    <p>
        Since then, the hotel has been abandoned and has become run-down, but it still has its historical charm.
